This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in PHP related to type juggling. The `bug.php` file contains a function designed to calculate the sum of numbers in an array. However, when the array includes non-numeric strings, PHP's automatic type coercion leads to unexpected results. The `bugSolution.php` provides a solution to mitigate this by explicitly type checking before summation.
